# 💵 Real or Fake Currency Detection  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **currency authentication system** using **image processing** and **machine learning**.  
It detects whether an Indian currency note (₹500 or ₹2000) is **real or fake** by analyzing its features and running it through a trained model.  

The project includes Jupyter notebooks for dataset preparation, model training/testing, and a simple **GUI interface** for real-time verification.
